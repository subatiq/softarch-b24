# Course Project Overview
Your task is to design a large-scale system based on the requirements provided [here](./requirements.md).

Please note that these requirements, like many aspects of real-world projects, may evolve over time. The updates will be posted in the course chat and the document will be updated. You can ask questions in the group chat with hashtag *#elicitation* and answers to them will be added to this document as soon as possible.

In the first lab, you will individually create an initial architectural document outlining your decisions and approach to the system’s architecture. This document will serve as your baseline but will not be graded. It is intended to help you establish a foundation for the project.
After the first revision, you will be organized into groups of four. Throughout the course, you will gain the knowledge needed to refine your design. As you learn, you will submit graded revisions of your work.

Keep in mind that we will assess your progress based on the material covered in lectures. However, feel free to make educated guesses for areas not yet discussed.
By the end of the course, you and your group will submit a comprehensive architectural document that fully describes the system.

## **A note on academic integrity**
We understand that generative AI tools can be tempting to use for shortcuts. However, the topics and materials in this course are specialized and unlikely to be found in AI datasets. We can recognize AI-generated content, and any misuse will be taken seriously.

!!! note
    That said, we encourage you to use AI for tasks like grammar checks or stylistic improvements — just as we used AI to refine this text for clarity and tone. Lots of puns were slaughtered in the process.

Plagiarism or unauthorized use of AI will result in a grade of D for a submission.

Good luck!
