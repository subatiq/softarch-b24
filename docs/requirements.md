### Additional comments from the customer
- Alerts should be timely; every minute counts.
- The system must be scalable to accommodate growth in the number of incidents and users. We expect a maximum of 100 issues with our systems per day. Our developers are REALLY good, and the systems should not break more often than that.
- The system should be user-friendly. New engineers should not need to spend much time understanding the UI.
- Engineers should not be able to hack into managers' accounts and override severities to increase payouts.
- We have many competitors in the industry because we are highly successful.
